The key of this operation is the application of shared memory. 
The basic steps are as follows:
	1. Put the input data into coarse bins;
	2. Use each thread block to compute a local histogram for the data that falls into a single coarse bin;
	3. Concatenate each of the coarse histogram together.
The local histogram will use shared memory to store it.

  The Work Complexity is O(N), 
  The Span Complexity is O(1).
	The N is the number of the elements.
